* Recall what the definitions of an `inorder`, `preorder` or `postorder` traversal in a binary tree are. Implement them as methods in your data structures.
  * Can you reconstruct a binary tree given its
    * only one of `preorder`, `postorder` or `inorder` traversals?
    * any two of them?
    * all three of them?

* What is the fewest nodes an AVL tree with height 10 could have?

* Unlike AVL Trees or Red Black Trees, which make sure that the height of neither subtree is too long, there are [size balanced trees](http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Size_Balanced_Tree) which make sure that neither of the subtrees is heavier than a constant multiple of the other subtree.

* Yet another interesting Balanced Binary Search Tree that does not involve rotations is the [2-3 Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%E2%80%933_tree)
