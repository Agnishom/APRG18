* If you did not know this already, python supports [function definitions inside function definitions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6791198/what-is-the-benefit-to-define-a-function-in-a-function-in-python)

* What you learnt last time in class is a specific kind of a Heap, known as the [Binary Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap)
  * There is a [whole lot of other heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#Comparison_of_theoretic_bounds_for_variants) which theoretically perform better and (are also fun to study).

* There is also a related data structure called a [Treap](https://threads-iiith.quora.com/Treaps-One-Tree-to-Rule-em-all-Part-1). It combines a tree and a heap to create a nice balanced search tree.

* Here are two interesting problems related to heaps:
  * As your input, you receive a set of primes and a number N. You have to output the Nth number whose prime factors are a subset of the given set.
  * [Minimum Average Waiting Time](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-average-waiting-time/): A scheduler keeps on receiving a number of requests to schedule jobs which take varying amount of times. The requests also arrive at different times. What should be the scheduler's strategy to schedule the jobs at hand so that the average waiting time for all the requests is minimized?
