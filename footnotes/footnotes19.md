* You saw the [closest pair problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem) in class. Could you find the farthest pair of points?
  * I am not sure of the answer. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2736290/how-to-find-two-most-distant-points) says finding the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms) might be a good start.

* Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, and it works perfectly fine assuming the input was permuted randomly. With similar assumptions, can you implement quickselect, which selects the i'th largest element in an array (possibly unsorted) in linear time?
  * Surprisingly, [there is a very beautiful algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians) that does this even without the assumption.
  * Can you find the median of two sorted arrays in logarithmic time?

* [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer/) has a nice collection of divide and conquer problems along with actual code.
