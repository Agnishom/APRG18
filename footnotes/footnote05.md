* If you are not sure how to implement Linked Lists, check out [this implementation](http://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/courses/prog2-2015/code/newlist_separate_classes.py)
  * You should try to implement the following data structures:
    * **Stack:** A data structure that allows you to to `push` an element to the top of the stack, check if the stack is empty, and `pop` an element.
    * **Queue:** A data structure that allows you to `enqueue` and `dequeue`. The result of a dequeue should be such that the dequeued element is the chronologically first element that was enqueued and is still in the queue.
    * **Circular Linked List:** Linked List where the next element of the last element points to the head of the linked list, again.

* What is the difference between a data structure and an abstract data type?
  * An abstract data type is a specification of what functionalities a data type should provide, and how they should behave when invoked.
  * A data structure is a concrete implementation of an abstract data type.
  * For example, a list is a data type. However, it could be implemented through dynamic arrays, or linked lists, which are data structures.

* What does the `self` that is passed on in class methods in idiomatic python stand for?

* Here is an interesting puzzler about circular linked lists. (Or maybe this is not about linked lists, if you do not want to think that way)

    > You are a servant in a palace. The palace is in the shape of a circle, and you do not know how many rooms there are in the palace.
    >
    > Some of the rooms have the lights on, some have the lights off. Your job is to turn all the lights off. I remind you again that the palace is ring shaped, and you do not know how many rooms there are in the palace.
    >
    > How would you turn off all the lights, and in the end inform your superior (via your cell phone) that you have completed your job?
