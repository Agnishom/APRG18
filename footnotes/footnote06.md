* Try adding the following methods to your `linkedList` class.
  * `linkedList.insert(i, data)`: Modifies the linkedlist by inserting `data` in the `i`th position.
  * `linkedList.remove(i)`: Removes the node at the i'th position and returns the data there
  * `linkedList.reverse()`: Reverses the given linkedList.

* How would you create a copy of a given linkedList?

* Try the linkedList problems at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/linked-lists/1)
* Does having linked lists help solve the problem of [Broken Keyboard - UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=3139) more elegantly than arrays?
* Suppose you are given an iterator to two linked lists. [Can you tell if they merge?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1594061/check-if-two-linked-lists-merge-if-so-where)
