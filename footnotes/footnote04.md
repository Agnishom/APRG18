* Do you need to load your python script in the interactive environment and play with it, like you used to, in GHCi?
  * Use `python -i filename.py`
  * If you are using IDLE, click on run module, and then you can use the REPL with the script loaded.

* Python has a [huge library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). You use the `import` statement to, well, import them.
  * Here are two fun libraries that you should try importing:
    * `import antigravity`
    * `import this`
