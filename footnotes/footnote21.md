* Consider the longest increasing subsequence problem: Given a sequence of size `N`, you have to determine one of the longest subsequences which is monotonic.  
  * As an exercise, try solving this problem with dynamic programming first. What is the complexity of your algorithm?
  * Actually, this problem [can be](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-increasing-subsequence/) solved in a much faster way.

* The [Egg Dropping](https://brilliant.org/wiki/egg-dropping/) problem asks the following question:
  > Suppose you have N eggs and you want to determine from which floors in a k-floor building you can drop an egg such that is doesn't break. You are to determine the minimum number of attempts you need in order find the critical floor in the worst case while using the best strategy.

  * How would you approach this problem?

* Here are two interesting links which talk about how dynamic programming can be applied to problems about trees:
