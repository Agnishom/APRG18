* If you are looking for them, [here](http://www.cmi.ac.in/~spsuresh/teaching/prgh15/lectures/lecture18.pdf) are some Haskell based lecture notes on AVL trees and the like.
  * Try implementing AVL trees in Python.
  * You might be able to appreciate that this is one of the things that are really clean in the Functional Programming Setting.

* A nice and interesting variant of Balanced Binary Search Trees are the [Red-Black Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redâ€“black_tree).
  * Can you try implementing them in Python?

* [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/bst) has a lot of cool visualizations of Data Structures.

* Check out the [balanced trees section](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/balanced-trees) on Hackerrank
